								ASSIGNMENT - 1
1)JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.JavaScript helps the users to build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. JavaScript is commonly used to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface by the DOM API. It is mainly used in web applications.


2)Client-side means that the processing takes place on the userâ€™s computer. It requires browsers to run the scripts on the client machine without involving any processing on the server.Server-side means that the processing takes place on a web server.


3)Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

4)JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function. Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.Three types of scope are local,global and block scope.


5)JavaScript is synchronous by default. But we can make a particular JavaScript code to asynchronous for performing multiple tasks at a time.


6)JavaScript is a single threaded language. This means it has one call stack and one memory heap.


7)The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way that a document is accessed and manipulated.The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
